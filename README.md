Description and Usage: Tracker app that records workout stats. User is able to view create and track daily workouts, log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day and is also able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, the user should be able to track their distance traveled.
